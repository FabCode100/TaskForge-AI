# TaskForge-AI Backend (FastAPI)

This is a minimal FastAPI scaffold for the TaskForge-AI marketplace backend.

Run locally:

```powershell
python backend_taskforge_ai/main.py
```

Or with Docker Compose:

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

The app exposes a health endpoint at `/health` and API routers under `/api/v1/`.
